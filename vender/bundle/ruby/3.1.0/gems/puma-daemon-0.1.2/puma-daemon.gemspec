  spec.description   = <<~DESCRIPTION

    In version 5.0 the authors of the popular Ruby web server Puma chose
    to remove the daemonization support from Puma, because the code wasn't wall maintained, 
    and because other and perhaps better options exist (such as systemd, etc), not to 
    mention many people have switched to Kubernetes and Docker, where you want to start 
    all servers on the foreground.

    And yet, something useful and simple got lost â€” in our humble opinion. Some folks were 
    indeed happily using the `--daemonize` feature until in 5.0 they got an error that this flag is 
    not supported.

    So, if you want to use the latest and greatest Puma 5+, but have it self-daemonize, 
    this gem is for you. Just use *pumad* binary instead of *puma*, or require 'puma/daemon' inside
    your config file.
